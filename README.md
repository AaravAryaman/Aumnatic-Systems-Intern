I started my intern at Aumnatic Systems Pvt Ltd on 06/05/2024. The main objective of this intern project was to make a flying micro drone running on self-made flight controller. 
  
In the first week I started off with the Production Team, learning about procedures of PCB production with SMT (Surafce Mount Technology)- stencil printing, pick and place, reflow and quality check. I also tried hand soldering some components onto PCBs. Finally, I performed the testing of PCB circuits that had been produced for a fishing board toy. Meanwhile, I also began my [Drone Research](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGEteYy6_s/aPfHe0JrymGLhPgnTHX_pQ/view?utm_content=DAGEteYy6_s&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor) on various drone components, laws & regulations and the Indian drone industry online from countless sources available.  
  
In the second week I was with the Design R&D Team, learning about PCB designing. I learnt PCB designing in the KiCAD software which is free, instead of the Altium software being used by the team. Firstly, I made a CAD model [Drone Frame](https://github.com/Aumnatic-Toytronics/Recreational-Hobby-Micro-Drone/tree/main/Drone%20Frame) in Fusion360. Later, I made a complete PCB design of a [Motor Driver](https://github.com/Aumnatic-Toytronics/Recreational-Hobby-Micro-Drone/tree/main/Motor%20Driver) in KiCAD, from schematic capture and assigning footprints to PCB layouting and generating gerber files. As not all symbols and footprints were available in KiCAD by default, I also [Digikey's KiCAD Library](https://github.com/Digi-Key/digikey-kicad-library.git).  
  
In the third week, I researched some micro drones available in the market and tried to understand the process and code for a [ESP32 based drone](https://espressif-docs.readthedocs-hosted.com/projects/espressif-esp-drone/en/latest/index.html) system. At the end of the week I started my 1-week training at JSM Composites.  
  
In the week from 23/05 - 31/05/2024, I completed an [Intern at JSM Composites](https://github.com/AaravAryaman/JSM-Composites-Intern.git). Here, I learnt about use of composites in the industry. I learnt about manufacture of carbon fibre sheets and machining processes and how industry-ready products are made from these carbon fibres. I was also tasked with making new designs or modifying some existing designs in Fusion360.  
  
From the next week onwards (fourth week), I was back with the Design R&D Team at Aumnatic Systems Pvt Ltd. We had ordered [Pluto 1.2](https://www.dronaaviation.com/pluto-1-2/) drone manufactured by Drona Aviation. The purpose for this was to figure out any potential difficulties and challenges that might occur when assembling and flying a drone. The only major difficulty faced during this operation was of making the drone hover as the strcuture seemed to have some inherent imbalance. Then, I studied the documentations for the Pluto 1.2 drone and tried a modification of [Debug APIs](https://github.com/Aumnatic-Toytronics/Recreational-Hobby-Micro-Drone/tree/main/Debug%20APIs) in the drone. The sofware used was [Cygnus IDE](https://create.dronaaviation.com/software/drone-programming/cygnus-ide#downloads). The code was written in /src/main/PlutoPilot.cpp using debugging APIs like Utils.h and Estimate.h to show change in LED color as drone moves upward or downward or just remains stationary. The given code can be run after creating a new workspace in Cygnus IDE and following proper guidelines for building and flashing the code. Here's a video showing the working of the modification-

In the fifth week, I made a ESP32 based [Flight Controller](https://github.com/Aumnatic-Toytronics/Recreational-Hobby-Micro-Drone/tree/main/Flight%20Controller) schematic in KiCAD. Assigning appropriate footprints to all component symbols and running ERC to resolve all errors and warnings. As not all symbols and footprints were available in KiCAD by default, I also [Digikey's KiCAD Library](https://github.com/Digi-Key/digikey-kicad-library.git). I had used the flight controller schematic of a ESPlane-V2-S2 drone as [Reference Schematic](https://espressif-docs.readthedocs-hosted.com/projects/espressif-esp-drone/en/latest/_static/ESPlane_V2_S2/SCH_ESPlane_V2_S2.pdf). I also made a PCB outline for this schematic in Fusion360 by referencing the [Primus V4](https://create.dronaaviation.com/hardware/flight-controllers/primus-v4) flight controller of Pluto 1.2, since this self-made flight controller will be used to replace of Pluto 1.2's flight controller to complete our project.  
  
In the sixth week, I started the study of [Crazyflie](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-firmware) and [ESP DSP Library](https://github.com/whyengineer/esp32-lin/tree/master/components/dsp_lib) source codes to be used in our ESP32 based flight controller to fly our drone. I also came across several open sourced self-projects available. I thoroughly went through the document regarding [ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s2/get-started/index.html) to learn the necesseties to build a project and flash it onto the device successfully.  
  
In the seventh week, while the self-made flight controller PCB was still in production, I 3D-printed the flight controller model after generating its g-code in Fusion360, to verify the mechanical design of the model. I used [Creality Ender-3 V2](https://www.crealitycloud.com/product/details/Ender-3-V2-6048caaf5852812341df35a6) for the 3D-print. I was also tasked with designing and 3D-printing a protective [USB-Camera Case](https://github.com/Aumnatic-Toytronics/Recreational-Hobby-Micro-Drone/tree/main/USB-Camera%20Case) in Fusion360.  
  
In the eighth and final week, I was tasked with designing a model for [Servo-Motor Motion-Sensing Gate Validator](https://github.com/Aumnatic-Toytronics/Recreational-Hobby-Micro-Drone/tree/main/Servo-Sensor%20Gate%20Validator) in Fusion360 that was then produced by laser cutting at Meta Branding. As my last task, I successfuly built a project and flashed it onto the self-made flight controller using [esp-drone](https://github.com/Aumnatic-Toytronics/Recreational-Hobby-Micro-Drone/tree/main/esp-drone). This code was sourced from [espressif esp-drone](https://github.com/espressif/esp-drone.git). To control the drone, I downloaded the [ESP-Drone App](https://www.pgyer.com/a27L) based on [ESP-Drone-Android](https://github.com/EspressifApps/ESP-Drone-Android), which used [Crazyflie-Android-Client](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-android-client) as source code. Following this, I concluded a successful flight test for the drone with all basic functions working as required.
